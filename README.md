#The "Back to Top" Firefox Addon
A lot of websites these days that I visit (blogs, forums, news, etc) have a lot of content going vertically down the page. Some have a "Back to Top" icon or button, but others don't. I suddenly realised that if I could put a little "Back to Top" icon in the corner of my Firefox, on the "Add-Ons Bar", I would have a button on every site.

So, I sat down, learned how to make Firefox addons, and here I am!

This plugin is open source, do whatever you like with it, but I ask that you link back here and don't try to pass it off completely as your own!

#To Install and Use
Download the repository, and open the .xpi file in Firefox. It will install the plugin from there

#To Compile
Clone the repo yourself and cd into the addon/ folder, and then run this command in Terminal (Mac & Linux users):

    zip -r BackToTop.xpi *

Windows users can do it by:

    Send To > Compressed (Zipped) Folder. Rename it to .xpi instead of .zip

To install it, see above step.

#Support
I wrote this in FF5.0.1. It's a very basic plugin so I can't see how older versions would struggle. If you try it in anything other than 5.0.1 and it works or has issues, let me know so I can update this bit.

#Future Plans
1. Make it so it actually scrolls up, not just jumps. (As an option)
2. Get a nicer icon. I'm no designer, if anyone fancies making a 25x25px nice icon, please do and I'll credit you!
